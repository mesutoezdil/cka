  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce            
      # Provides read and write access from a single node.
      # This mode allows a volume to be mounted by only one node at a time.
    - ReadOnlyMany            
      # Allows multiple nodes to have read-only access simultaneously.
      # The volume can be used by multiple nodes but only for read operations.
    - ReadWriteMany           
      # Allows multiple nodes to have read and write access simultaneously.
      # This means multiple nodes can use the same volume for both reading and writing.
