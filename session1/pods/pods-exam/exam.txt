Q1: Schedule a Pod as follows:
✑ Name: kucc8
✑ App Containers: 2
✑ Container Name/Images:
- nginx
- redis


Q2:  An existing Pod needs to be integrated into Kubernetes' built-in logging architecture (e.g., kubectl logs). Adding a streaming sidecar container is a common solution to achieve this requirement.
Task:
Add a sidecar container named sidecar, using the busybox image, to the existing Pod big-corp-app. The new sidecar container must run the following command:
bash
Copy code
/bin/sh -c "tail -n+1 -f /var/log/big-corp-app.log"
Use a Volume mounted at /var/log to make the log file big-corp-app.log available to the sidecar container.

Q3:   Retrieve the logs of the existing Pod named nginx and write them to a file named podlogs.txt.

Q4: Schedule a Pod as follows:

• Name: kucc1
• App Containers: 2
• Container Name/images:
o redis
o nginx
all containers same volume and volume name: sharedvolume path: /var/log
