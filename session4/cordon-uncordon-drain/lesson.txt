### Cordon, Uncordon, and Node Drain in Kubernetes

#### Kubernetes Cordon and Uncordon

**Cordon:**
Prevents new pods from being scheduled on a node.

```bash
kubectl cordon <node_name>
```

- **Effect:** New pods will not be assigned to the node, but existing pods will continue to run.

**Uncordon:**
Allows new pods to be scheduled on the node again.

```bash
kubectl uncordon <node_name>
```

- **Effect:** The node becomes available for scheduling new pods.

---

#### Kubernetes Node Drain

**Drain:**
Safely evicts all pods from a node to prepare it for maintenance or shutdown.

```bash
kubectl drain <node_name> --ignore-daemonsets
```

- **Effect:** All pods, except DaemonSet pods, are moved to other nodes.

**Option:**
- `--ignore-daemonsets`: Ignores DaemonSet pods and does not attempt to evict them.

---

#### Summary of Use Cases:
- **Cordon:** Stop new pods from being scheduled on a node before maintenance.
- **Uncordon:** Re-enable the node for workloads after maintenance.
- **Drain:** Evacuate pods from a node for safe maintenance or shutdown.
