Kubernetes Upgrade Steps
Find the Latest Patch Version for 1.31:
Update package lists and check available versions of kubeadm.
sudo apt update
sudo apt-cache madison kubeadm
Look for the latest version in the format 1.31.x-* where x is the latest patch version.
Upgrade kubeadm:
Replace x with the selected patch version.
sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.31.x
Prepare the Node for Maintenance:
Mark the node as unschedulable and drain workloads.
kubectl drain <node-to-drain> --ignore-daemonsets
Upgrade kubelet and kubectl:
Unlock the packages, upgrade to the latest patch version, and lock them again.
sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && \
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.31.x-* kubectl=1.31.x-* && \
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
Restart Kubelet:
Reload the system daemon and restart kubelet.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
Bring the Node Back Online:
Mark the node as schedulable again.
kubectl uncordon <node-to-uncordon>
Verify Cluster Status:
Check the state of the nodes to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
kubectl get nodes
Notes
apt-mark unhold kubeadm: Unlocks kubeadm for updates if previously held.
--ignore-daemonsets: Ensures pods managed by DaemonSets are not stopped or moved during the drain process. These pods remain on the node even after draining.
