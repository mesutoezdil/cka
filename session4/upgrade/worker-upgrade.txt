Kubernetes Worker Node and Master Node Upgrade Steps
Worker Node: Upgrade kubeadm
SSH into the worker node:
ssh worker-node
Upgrade kubeadm to the desired version (replace x with the latest patch version for 1.31):
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.31.x-* && \
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
Upgrade the node using kubeadm:
sudo kubeadm upgrade node
Master Node: Prepare for Maintenance
SSH into the master/control plane node:
ssh master-node
Mark the node as unschedulable and drain workloads:
kubectl drain <node-to-drain> --ignore-daemonsets
Worker Node: Upgrade kubelet and kubectl
Return to the worker node and upgrade kubelet and kubectl:
sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && \
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.31.x-* kubectl=1.31.x-* && \
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
Restart kubelet:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
Master Node: Restore Node Availability
Return to the master/control plane node and uncordon the node:
kubectl uncordon <node-to-uncordon>
Verify the cluster status:
kubectl get nodes
Notes
Replace <node-to-drain> and <node-to-uncordon> with the appropriate node names.
Always verify compatibility between kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl versions before upgrading.
Perform these steps during a maintenance window to minimize disruption.
