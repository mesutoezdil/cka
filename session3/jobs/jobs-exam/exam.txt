QUESTION: Kubernetes Job with Retry Policy and Completion

Requirements

You are required to create a Job in Kubernetes. The `Job` should run a specific command and keep retrying until it completes `successfully`. Configure the Job according to the following requirements:

- The Job should be named "`ops`".
- Each pod should use the `busybox` image and run the command: `echo "Hello Ops!"`.
- Completions: The Job should be considered `complete` after successfully running at least `3` pods.
- BackoffLimit: The Job should retry up to `5` times if a pod fails.
- RestartPolicy: Never. Pods should not automatically restart if they fail.

Create a Kubernetes Job YAML file that meets the above requirements and explain each part of the configuration.
